## Tests
Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/)

  * You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements 
  * Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
```
   - in the best case
   - in the average case
